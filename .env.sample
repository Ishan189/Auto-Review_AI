# =========================================
# Tips to Avoid Rate Limiting:
# =========================================
# - If you get blocked often: INCREASE all delay values
# - For overnight processing: Set MIN=10, MAX=20, BATCHES=30-60
# - For faster (risky): Set MIN=1, MAX=3, but not recommended
# - See CONFIG.md for detailed guide
